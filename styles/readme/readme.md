# This is a webpage utilizing the NASA site as inspiration

Welcome to my clone of the NASA website. This project is for the module 5 assignment given during the Software Engineering coursework through Coding Temple. This website loads elements onto the page dynamically using placeholders and Javascript. There are some really cool features that I was able to play around with and I hope that you enjoy it!

## About

The Travis Clone is a spectacular display of some of the most amazing images that we have been able to capture utilizing the photographic capabilities of structures like the Hubble or the James Webb Telescope. 

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rigil87/Favorite-Site.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
   

## Usage

   Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to view the website.

## Pages

Home Page (index.html)
   The home page is the only properly structured page, however the barebones are there to expand to any number of additional pages necessary to display additional content. The sky is the limit so to say....terrible pun.

   There are numerous elements included on the main homepage. Everything is dynamic and loaded into the page utilizing Javascript. This helps to organize our code. I found this extremely helpful as I worked within the code I'd created. Each section is its own element. 

   Some of the elements on the page includes multiple cards, a dynamic and interesting navbar, and a countdown to a launch for NASA!!!!
